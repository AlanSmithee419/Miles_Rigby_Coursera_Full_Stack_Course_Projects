            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                Hello, I am a theoretical physics graduate from the University of York.
                Since graduating, I have become increasingly interested in persuing different forms of
                prorgamming challenges, including game development and the full stack. As part of this,
                this website was initially created during my learning full stack development through
                Microsoft's Coursera course. My hope is for this to act as a presentation of what I've
                learned, as well as a place for interesting and fun experiences I've worked on.

                <h4>Simple Coursera Projects</h4>
                <p>
                    I've made a couple of small programming projects during a full-stack development
                    course on Coursera, which I am currently continuing to progress through. So far,
                    I have completed three projects - a simple console-based stock tracker, and a
                    less complex, but more object-oriented with effective seperation of tasks, library 
                    manager. Finally this website itself is my most recent completed project for this
                    course.

                <h4>Incremental Game in Unity</h4>
                <p>
                    A purely UI-based incremental game in a survival fantasy setting. The game is built
                    in C# using Unity, and version control through GitHub and VSCode. The idea is to use
                    this project to create a fun experience while developing my abilities with the basics of
                    Unity and in particular menu-based UI and navigation, before moving to more complex
                    projects.
