This repository consists of a series of projects developed as part of my personal development through the
Microsoft Full Stack Developer Certificate course on Coursera. These projects are contained in separate
folders, listed below in order of creation:

1. C#_StockManager - a simple text-based system built in C# that can be run in a terminal. Data on stock
                     items, such as prices and quantities, is stored in lists and is deleted upon exiting
                     the program. Makes significant use of input validation and error handling.

2. C#_LibraryManager - a simple text-based system built in C# that runs in the terminal. Makes use of a 
                       more object oriented approach, having distinct classes in seperate project code 
                       files for different funcitonality, such as for handling user input, a Library class 
                       for storing books, and a User class for borrowing and returning books to the library

3. PortfolioSite - an HTML/CSS/JavaScript project for a Portfolio website, containing relevant sections
                   including an About Me (currently containing Lorem Ipsum-like placeholder text), a
                   Skills section with appropriate icons, and a form with input validation (currently
                   does nothing, the data is not sent anywhere). There is also a Projects section with
                   filtering projects with different categories, and a card layout. Images in Projects
                   can be clicked to display them in a modal view. The site is also responsive to narrow
                   screens and windows, switching to a more vertical layout below 768px width.
                   The site is created through github pages and can be viewed at:
