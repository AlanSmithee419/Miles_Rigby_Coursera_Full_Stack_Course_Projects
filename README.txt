This repository consists of a series of projects developed as part of my personal development through the
Microsoft Full Stack Developer Certificate course on Coursera. These projects are contained in separate
folders, listed below in order of creation:

1. C#_StockManager - a simple text-based system built in C# that can be run in a terminal. Data on stock
                     items, such as prices and quantities, is stored in lists and is deleted upon exiting
                     the program.
